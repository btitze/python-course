# Python Course Material

Presentations, Jupyter Notebooks, and practice data for a series of Python courses I taught at the FMI in 2019 and 2020.

The folders [for_beginners](for_beginners) (session 1), [data_handling_and_analysis](data_handling_and_analysis) (session 2), and [image_processing](image_processing) (session 3) belong to the same course. The second and the third session assume a working knowledge of Python (covered in session 1).

The folder [general_intro_and_oop](general_intro_and_oop) contains material for a separate workshop that included object-oriented programming (OOP).
