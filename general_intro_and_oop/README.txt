This is the material of the first Python workshop at the Friedrich Miescher Institute, held on 24th July 2019.

You'll find the Powerpoint presentation here (some material at the end was cut out because we couldn't cover everything.)

There are four Jupyter notebooks:

review_basics.ipynb - The programming exercise at the beginning (Asking for a user's name and age + palindrome and prime 
                      number check)

And notebooks for the three packages we looked at:

textblob-example.ipynb - natural language processing 
sympy-example.ipynb - symbolic maths
networkx-example.ipynb - creating, manipulating and analysing networks 

Code in .py files for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercise:

shapes.py - The 3D shapes module
shapes-main.py - Some code to play with objects created from shapes.py. Run this with "python shapes-main.py"

shapes_properties.py - Like shapes.py, but using properties in the Sphere class
shapes-main_properties.py - Run this with "python shapes-main_properties.py" to use the shapes_properties module
